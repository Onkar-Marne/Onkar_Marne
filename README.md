# 👋 Hi, I'm Onkar Marne  
### Python Backend Engineer | Python • FastAPI • Django • AWS | Building Agentic Workflows & Cloud-Native Systems

---

I am a Cloud & Python Backend Engineer specializing in agentic workflows, microservices, and production-grade API development.  
My work focuses on building LLM-powered systems, scalable backend architectures, and cloud-native deployments using Docker & AWS.

From 2021–2024, I dedicated time to upskilling in Python, AI/LLMs, DevOps, and cloud technologies. During this period, I built multiple real-world projects that strengthened my engineering fundamentals and prepared me for modern backend & AI roles.
